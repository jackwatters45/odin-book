# Odin Book

- post display social (likes, comments, shares) not fitting properly
- dialogs not fit meep

<!--  -->

- notifications

- check nested user profile still good
  - post scroll part meh
- viewing own friends is totally wrong (use isOwnProfile)
- nested shared posts!!! (something needs to be populated)

- test populate shit one last time (also check all dialogs)
- check nothing bad
- tests
  - fix backend + make sure existing frontend tests work

## eventually look into

- sharing types between backend and frontend
- best way to upload to npm and build for prod (commonjs etc)
